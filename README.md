This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
NOTE: If running from a development server, several functionalities will
be missing or broken because you will not have the necessary environment
variables. To see a working build, use the deployment server (see below). 

Donwload Node JS if not already installed on device: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
If using Visual Studio Code, you may have to type "npm i next".

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
